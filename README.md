## About the Data

### Data Source

The television energy consumption dataset comes from the Australian Government’s Energy Rating database. This dataset records appliance models, screen sizes, technologies, brands, star ratings, and energy consumption (kWh/year).

### Data Processing

-   Cleaned raw dataset by removing duplicates and incomplete records.
-   Normalized screen size values (e.g., ensuring inches were consistent).
-   Filtered for television models relevant to the Australian market.
-   Aggregated by brand, size, and technology to generate frequency distributions.
-   Derived relationships (e.g., screen size vs. power) using summary statistics and visualization.

### Privacy

The dataset does not contain any personal or sensitive information. It only describes appliances available in the market. No user-identifiable data was used.

### Accuracy and Limitations

-   Accuracy depends on manufacturers’ self-reported energy data.
-   Models on the market may change quickly; data may not reflect the very latest appliances.
-   Star ratings are standardized, but consumer energy use varies depending on real-world habits (e.g., brightness settings, standby usage).
-   Sample may be skewed toward more popular brands and models listed in the government dataset.

### Ethics

-   The data is publicly available and used for educational purposes only.
-   Visualizations are meant to inform consumers and students, not to promote or criticize any brand.
-   Care was taken to avoid misrepresentation of results.
