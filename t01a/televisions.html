                <h1>Welcome to Appliance Energy Consumption in Australia</h1>
                <p>
                    Explore energy consumption of household appliances in the
                    Australian market. Learn how to save energy and reduce your
                    bills!

                <p>Quick Facts:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Energy labels (star ratings) help compare appliance
                        efficiency at a glance.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Standby power can add unexpected costs—turn devices
                        fully off when not in use.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Choosing higher-efficiency models usually pays back
                        through lower electricity bills.

                <p>
                    <strong>Size & technology matter.</strong> Larger screens
                    and older tech (e.g., plasma) use more energy. Modern
                    LED/LCD and OLED sets are generally more efficient.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Use the TV’s Energy Saver or Eco mode and reduce
                        brightness where comfortable.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Disable “always-listening” voice features if you don’t
                        use them; they can add standby draw.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Consider star rating and annual kWh on the energy label
                        when purchasing.
                    </li>

                    Placeholder note: Insert simple examples of annual kWh for
                    common TV sizes in Australia to make this page concrete.

                <h3>TV Energy Insights: Data Story</h3>
                This section presents findings from the Australian Government’s
                Television Energy Rating dataset. The aim is to help Australian
                consumers make informed decisions about technology, size, brand,
                and efficiency.
