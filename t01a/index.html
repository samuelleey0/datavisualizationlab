                    Explore energy consumption of household appliances in the
                    Australian market. Learn how to save energy and reduce your

                <p>Quick Facts:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Energy labels (star ratings) help compare appliance
                        efficiency at a glance.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Standby power can add unexpected costs—turn devices
                        fully off when not in use.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Choosing higher-efficiency models usually pays back
                        through lower electricity bills.

                <h1>Televisions</h1>
                <p>
                    <strong>Size & technology matter.</strong> Larger screens
                    and older tech (e.g., plasma) use more energy. Modern
                    LED/LCD and OLED sets are generally more efficient.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Use the TV’s Energy Saver or Eco mode and reduce
                        brightness where comfortable.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Disable “always-listening” voice features if you don’t
                        use them; they can add standby draw.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Consider star rating and annual kWh on the energy label
                        when purchasing.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h3>TV Energy Insights: Data Story</h3>
                This section presents findings from the Australian Government’s
                Television Energy Rating dataset. The aim is to help Australian
                consumers make informed decisions about technology, size, brand,
                and efficiency.
                <h4>
                    Chart 1: What type of TV screen technologies are currently
                    available in Australia and which are the most frequent?
                </h4>
                <img
                    src="data/Q1.png"
                    alt="Pie Chart of TV Screen Technologies "
                />
                <p>
                    Most TVs in Australia are LCD LED, while OLED is less
                    common.
                </p>
                <h4>
                    Chart 2: What screen sizes are currently available, and
                    which are the most frequent?
                </h4>
                <img src="data/Q2.png" alt="Bar Chart of TV Screen Sizes" />
                <p>
                    55-inch TVs are the most common, followed by 65 and 75
                    inches.
                </p>
                <h4>
                    Chart 3: Which brands have the greatest number of different
                    models?
                </h4>
                <img src="data/Q3.png" alt="Bar Chart of TV Brands" />
                <p>
                    Samsung, Kogan, and LG have the largest number of models on
                    the Australian market.
                </p>
                <h4>
                    Chart 4: Which type of screen technology consumes the least
                    amount of power?
                </h4>
                <img
                    src="data/Q4.png"
                    alt="Least Power Consumption by Screen Type"
                />
                <p>
                    LCD TVs consume the least power, while OLEDs use slightly
                    more but offer higher performance.
                </p>
                <h4>
                    Chart 5: What is the relationship between screen size and
                    power use?
                </h4>
                <img
                    src="data/Q5.png"
                    alt="Relationship between Screen Size and Power Use"
                />
                <p>
                    Larger TVs use more power — the relationship is clearly
                    positive.
                </p>
                <h4>
                    Chart 6: What is the relationship between star rating and
                    screen size?
                </h4>
                <img
                    src="data/Q6.png"
                    alt="Relationship between Star Rating and Screen Size"
                />
                <p>
                    Star ratings are fairly distributed across all sizes; bigger
                    TVs can still be efficient if well designed.
                </p>
                <h4>Conclusion</h4>
                <p>
                    When choosing a TV, balance size, brand, and efficiency. A
                    55-inch LED TV is common and energy-smart for most
                    households.
